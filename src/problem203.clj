;;..... there is always a better way ... 

;; C(n,k)
(defn C [n k]
  (/ (factorial n) (* (factorial k) (factorial (- n k)))))

;; [daniel.is.fischer] Any prime dividing C(n,k) is â‰¤ n, so you need only the primes up to 47.

;; [MarleysGhost] I was surprised at how few primes were necessary. By the time even the largest elements of the triangle were divided by primes up through 43, they were reduced to less than 47*47.
;; [quilan] Well, yeah... highest numerator term [ n! / (k!*(n-k)!) ] is going to be 51!, so the highest prime-factor will have to be <= 51. Therefore, 47.
