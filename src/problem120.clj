;; Let r be the remainder when (a-1)^n + (a+1)^n is divided by aÂ².

;; For example, if a = 7 and n = 3, then r = 42: 63 + 83 = 728  42 mod 49. 
;; And as n varies, so too will r, but for a = 7 it turns out that r-max = 42.

;; For 3 <= a <= 1000, find sum r_max.

;; (a+1)^n == an+1 (mod a^2), and (a-1)^n == an-1 or 1-an (mod a^2) depending whether n is odd or even; the sum is therefore either 2an or 2. 

;; When a is odd, this is always maximised at a^2-a (as in the example with a=7), achieved for example when n=(a-1)/2; when a is even, it is maximised at a^2-2a for a>2, achieved for example when n=(a-2)/2. 

;; The separate sums for odd and even terms are easily enough calculated, but it was quicker to knock out a line of code: 

;; perl -wle '$s+=$_*($_-2+($_&1)) for 3..1000; print $s'
