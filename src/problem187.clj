; A composite is a number containing at least two prime factors. 
; For example, 15 = 3 5; 9 = 3  3; 12 = 2  2  3.

; There are ten composites below thirty containing precisely two, not necessarily distinct, prime factors: 4, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, 25, 26.

; How many composite integers, n < 10^8, have precisely two, not necessarily distinct, prime factors?

;; the naÃ¯ve way:
;; (count (filter #(= 2 (count (factors %))) (range 2 (expt 10 3))))
;; 299
;; (count (filter #(= 2 (count (factors %))) (range 2 (expt 10 4))))
;; 2625
;; .. 

;; highest number below 10^8 that has two distinct factors must be below 
;; (/ 2 10^8) = 50000000 < 2 * highest prime below 50000000
;; (factors 49999997)
;; [1181 42337]
;; (factors 49999993)
;; [31 1612903]
;; (factors 49999991)
;; [49999991]
;; this number is the largest prime that can be paired with a number below 10^8
